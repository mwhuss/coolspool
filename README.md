# CoolSpool

> That's about as cool as a pink fanny pack. - My Wife

*CoolSpool* is an empty filament spool designed for small printers and require no screws. While there are many filament spools available I couldn't find one that I liked and could print on my [Printrbot Play](https://printrbot.com/shop/assembled-printrbot-play/). View it on [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1459166) to use the Customizer.

## Features

* Designed for small printers.
* Built in [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org) to allow for customizations.
* Customize the number of supports, screw hole sizes, diameter, and more.
* Support arms are snap to fit.
* Screw holes available so you can install your own side support.

## Printing

I printed all the pieces in ~5hrs at 40mm/s.
